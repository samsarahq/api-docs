Tags are a simple way to organize vehicles, drivers, assets, and sensors into easily identifiable groups. You can add unlimited entities to each tag, and entities can have multiple different tags. You can also use tag hierarchies in order to create nested classes, such as parent tag 'Massachusetts' and child tag 'Boston'. They also allow you to restrict access to data through "tag-level" permissions.
